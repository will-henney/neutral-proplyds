** What files are we using?

*** PC mosaic
- Files in [[file:../../JorgeBowshocks/HST/]]
  - ~wcs_GO5469PCf656e_sharp_16.fits~ for Ha
  - Similarly f631e, f547e, f673e
  - WCS adjustments in
    - [[file:../pc-mosaic-f547m-LV456.wcs]]
    - etc
      
*** WFC mosaic
- Files in [[file:../../../Work/BobPC/2002/]]
  - ~final673-radec_sharp_16.fits~, etc
  - These still need a bit of work on the alignment
** Method for measuring fluxes
- We need to isolate the emission from
  - the disk and neutral wind
  - the ionization front
  - the star
- For this, we use the following bands
  - F631N  which is mainly oi, from i-front and disk, but also some
  - F656N  which is mainly Ha from i-front, with very little stellar continuum
  - F547M which is mainly stellar continuum, with a bit of nebular continuum
  - F673N which is sii from i-front (weak) plus stellar continuum
- We can plot profiles vs radius from proplyd center (star if seen)
  - Then subtract off the stellar profile and the i-front profile to get the disk flow contribution
  - At least, in theory 
** How to calculate the profiles
1. Find the radius and PA of all pixels with respect to the proplyd
2. Define an orientation PA0 for the proplyd
   - either the PA  to th1C
   - or a value defined by hand
3. plot brightness versus radius for all pixels within +/- 90 deg of PA0
4. Make some routines in whispy to do this

*** DONE Easy method - use the WCS shifts we already have

These are the WCS files I made when I did the alignment by hand

Unfortunately, I cannot remember which ones I used for the 673 and 631 filters.  I will assume that they are the same as 547

#+RESULTS:

*** Harder method - do source detection and loo for the average shift

** Coordinates of the proplyds
- It turns out that the OW94 coordinates from SIMBAD are not quite accurate enough
- We could maybe use the Ricci coordinates instead
  - We can still use SIMBAD but using the ~[RRS2008]~ prefix instead
  - No, that does not work. It just uses the Ricci ID to identify the source, but  it
